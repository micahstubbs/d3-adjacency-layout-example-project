A simple D3 layout that creates an adjacency matrix. In an adjacency matrix, unlike an arc diagram or a force-directed layout, the links are not lines and the nodes are not circles (or other icons). Instead, all nodes are shown across the x and y axes, and a link is indicated by a filled grid cell where the connected nodes meet.

The layout also includes helper functions to draw the x and y axes to label the nodes.

The most current version of the layout is [here](https://github.com/emeeks/d3-plugins/tree/master/adjacencyMatrix).
